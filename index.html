						<h2>Travel Helper: Check Gas Prices</h2>
						<br>
						<p>During the Spring and Summer, I do a lot of hiking. Unfortunately, most of 
						the nice trails are over an hour away from me, which means I'm not very familiar
						with the area.<br><br>
						I remember one of my trips during this past Summer ended in a mess. We nearly ran out of 
						gas somewhere in Fredrick County, so we grabbed the first available gas station and 
						filled our tank. However, every gas station we saw afterwards was significantly cheaper and 
						I felt we were a bit ripped off.<br><br>
						So, I'll be writing a Python bot to find the lowest gas prices in a small radius. The 
						original plan was to use Google Places API and request the prices for gas_stations, but I ran into a little problem
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<img src="CGP1.jpg" alt="CGP1" style="width:301px;height:409px;">
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>As you can see, the API request can get location just fine, but there's no listing for prices. 
						It's really strange because the prices for each gas station are still listed on google maps.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>With Google Places not cooperating, I took a look at other API's and <a href="http://www.mygasfeed.com/keys/api">myGasFeed</a> looked promising. 
						The API was relatively easy to implement and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Gas-Check-Bot-712545495568898/">bot</a> seems successful. It will
						need to be approved, but once it is finished you will be able to send a location from the FB mobile app and then ask "What gas stations are near me?" to get
						a list of all gas stations within a 2 mile radius ordered by distance, their prices, and their address.</p>
