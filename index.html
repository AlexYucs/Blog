					<h2>Discord.py Music Bot</h2>
					<h4>May 2017</h4>
					<br>
					<p>Discord is a popular <a href="https://discordapp.com/">voice chat application</a>
						capable of running on most major operating systems. Because of how easily bots can
						be integrated into the servers, there is a large community devoted to bot development.
					</p>
					<br>
					<div class = "pic">
						<br>
						<img src="Discord.png" alt="DSC" style="width:300px;height:86px;">
						<br>
						<br>
					</div>
					<h3>Goal: Playing Mp3 Files</h3>
					<br>
					<p>After playing around with the Discord API, I decided to make my own music bot. There
						are many very popular music bots out such as <a href="https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot">Just-Some-Bots' Music Bot</a>,
						but I've noticed that most of them use Youtube Downloader instead of mp3 files already
						on the owner's computer.
					</p>
					<br>
					<div class = "pic">
						<br>
						<img src="mp3.png" alt="MP3" style="width:300px;height:127px;">
						<br>
						<br>
					</div>
					<p>Since my computer already has a large collection of mp3 files, I decided to
						modify the example playlist bot from the Discord.py API. Like Just-Some-Bots, this
						example also uses Youtube Downloader, but it provided a good start point.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Stream a Single Mp3 File</h3>
					<br>
					<p>Playing a single Mp3 file was fairly simple. The <i>create_ffmpeg_player("file.mp3")</i>
						method from the API creates a Player object and this streams the music once a bot connects to a voice channel.
						So the "play" command was replaced by a random search for an mp3 from a Music folder and a new player creation.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Continuous Playing</h3>
					<br>
					<p>The original code relied on a playlist and a queue of music from Youtube requested by people in the chat.
						Unfortunately, this needed to be completely scrapped for this Mp3 Shuffle Bot. Once again, the <i>create_ffmpeg_player("file.mp3")</i>
						had a solution for this. There is an "after" parameter in the method which runs a function immediately after the stream ends.
						By having it call a <i>cont</i> method to reroll the song and continue playing, I created an unending playlist.
						Finally, the forward and backward options were recycled from my previous music player project, <a href="https://github.com/AlexYucs/PyMusic">PyMusic</a>.
						The forked version of Discord.py API with my new music bot can be found <a href="https://github.com/AlexYucs/discord.py">here</a>.

					<h2>Movie Tracker Java</h2>
					<h4>March 2017</h4>
					<br>
					<p>It's spring break and time for a new project! This time I'll be working on a
					java application to track movie ratings on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a>. First off, I'll
					need to web scrape information from their site.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Web Scraping with Jsoup</h3>
					<br>
					<p>Luckily, I found <a href="https://jsoup.org/">Jsoup</a> pretty quickly. It's an open source
					java library for interpreting html on webpages. It was easy to use and very similar to the module
					<a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> that I used for webscraping with python.
					With the webscraper all set, the next step will be interpreting the information.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Data Structures</h3>
					<br>
					<p>To store all of this information, I created a Movie Class. This could record everything from titles,
						directors, and ratings. The information from the html was relatively easy to parse, so everything could
						be sent in through the constructor for the class. There is even room to add personal ratings to each movie.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>Up next is the issue of being able to sort the movies by rating. First, I set up an Arraylist to store all of the
						movies and tried a heap sort. Although it worked fine for sorting the movies, I eventually settled on a quicksort for a cleaner
						implementation.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Future Goals</h3>
					<br>
					<p>The basis for the <a href="https://github.com/AlexYucs/MovieRec">Movie Ratings Java App</a> have been set up. There are still a lot of directions this project can go.
						I will be planning on setting up a GUI and extend the movie scraper to more than IMDb Top 250.

					<h2>Minimalistic Python Music Player Overlay</h2>
					<h4>Jan 2017</h4>
					<p>I'm always a fan of minimalistic design. The goal for this project was to create a lightweight
					Music Player with only 6 buttons, Play, Pause, Forward, Backward, and Volume Controls. Similar to a
					Digital iPod Shuffle."</p>
					<div class = "pic">

						<img src="PMShuf.png" alt="PMS" style="width:300px;height:283px;">

						<b>iPod Shuffle</b>
						<br>
						<br>
					</div>
					<p>I tried to start with the python vlc module, but it was a bit too reliant on plugins. The next best option
					was to use a self-sufficient module that could play mp3 files. Luckily I found <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/music.html">pygame</a>. Then after adding a few basic
				data structures to the code (Queue, Stack, etc), a skip and rewind function were created.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Graphical User Interface</h3>
					<br>
					<p>With the music player organized, it was time to make the GUI. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a> python module made it very simple.
					<br><br>1. Create a window<br>2. Add in the buttons along a grid<br>3. Make a draggable label<br>4. Use overrideredirect<br><br>The <a href ="https://github.com/AlexYucs/PyMusic">result</a> was an
				unobstrusive music player overlay and with Pyinstaller I converted this into an executable file. I was very happy with how it ended up.</p>

					<h2>Travel Helper: Check Gas Prices</h2>
					<h4>Jan 2017</h4>
					<p>During the Spring and Summer, I do a lot of hiking. Unfortunately, most of the nice trails are over an hour away from me, which means I'm not very familiar with the area.<br><br> I remember one of my trips during this past Summer ended in a mess.
						We nearly ran out of gas somewhere in Fredrick County, so we grabbed the first available gas station and filled our tank. However, every gas station we saw afterwards was significantly cheaper and I felt we were a bit ripped off.<br><br> So, I'll
						be writing a Python bot to find the lowest gas prices in a small radius. The original plan was to use Google Places API and request the prices for gas_stations, but I ran into a little problem
					</p>
					<br>
					<div class="pic">
						<b>Google Places API JSON response</b>
						<br>
						<img src="CGP1.jpg" alt="CGP1" style="width:301px;height:409px;">
						<br>
						<br>
					</div>
					<p>As you can see, the API request can get location just fine, but there's no listing for prices. It's really strange because the prices for each gas station are still listed on google maps.</p>
					<br>
					<div class="pic">
						<b>myGasFeed API JSON response</b>
						<br>
						<img src="CGP2.jpg" alt="CGP2" style="width:300px;height:346px;">
						<br>
						<br>
					</div>
					<p>With Google Places not cooperating, I took a look at other API's and <a href="http://www.mygasfeed.com/keys/api">myGasFeed</a> looked promising. The API was relatively easy to implement and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Gas-Check-Bot-712545495568898/">bot</a>						seems successful. It will need to be approved, but once it is finished you will be able to send a location from the FB mobile app and then ask "What gas stations are near me?" to get a list of all gas stations within a 2 mile radius ordered by distance,
						their prices, and their address. All you had to send was "http://api.mygasfeed.com/stations/radius/(Latitude)/(Longitude)/(distance)/(fuel type)/(sort by)/(APIKEY).json?"</p>
					<br>
					<div class="pic">
						<b>Final Product</b>
						<br>
						<img src="CGP3.jpg" alt="CGP3" style="width:300px;height:346px;">
						<br>
						<br>
					</div>
					<p>The code was relatively simple, just send the url request with the key and gps coordinates, then parse the json response. The errors I had were mostly typos and they were cleared up with a few print statements and a bit of log monitoring. The most
						embarassing error was an extra "\n" in the default location text file. I didn't catch it until one of the Facebook tester accidentally hit an infinite loop. Luckily, I shut the app down and repaired it before that went out of control.
